# Flux for srelens

Native srelens extension with explicitly granted, host-confirmed GitOps actions. This repository owns the manifest, tests,
documentation and independent releases. Discovery metadata lives in
[srelens/extensions](https://github.com/srelens/extensions).

## Preview compatibility

This version requires the declarative action host from
[srelens #551](https://github.com/srelens/srelens/issues/551), extension API `^0.3`.
The exact tested host commit is recorded in `compatibility.json`. Earlier API
hosts cannot install this version; no compatibility alias is provided.
The Kubernetes controllers and matching CRDs must already be installed.

## Install

Once this version is published in the catalog, install it through a compatible
host's app catalog. Review the requested read and write grants before installing
or updating. Connect the desired cluster and open the extension's pages.

Official release assets include `manifest.json`, its detached Ed25519 signature
`manifest.json.sig`, and `SHA256SUMS`. The host verifies the publisher and retains
control of grants, cluster scope, credentials, rendering and mutation confirmation.
Reading a kind does not implicitly authorize writes; each declared action needs
its primitive's explicit grant, and each mutation uses the host confirmation.

## Development

Use Python 3 and the Rust toolchain required by the pinned srelens checkout.
Clone `srelens/srelens` into `.host`, check out `hostRevision` from
`compatibility.json`, then run:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
python3 scripts/validate.py
python3 scripts/package.py --version 0.4.0
```

Validation uses the actual srelens manifest parser and capability broker. It
registers operations without querying a cluster. CI pins the host revision so an
upstream branch change cannot silently redefine compatibility. Update that pin
only after checking the new contract. Preserve the extension ID on updates.

## Releases

Increment the manifest version and changelog through a PR. Run the **Release
preview manifest** workflow with that version after validation. It publishes a
versioned manifest, publisher signature and checksums, then submit a separate catalog PR with the new
version, asset URL, checksum and tested host revision. Catalog inclusion grants
no permissions and may point to independently maintained community repositories.

## Declared actions

Suspend, Resume and Reconcile are declared for the supported Flux resources.
HelmRelease also declares Force reconcile and Reset retries. Suspended resources
refuse reconciliation; force/reset include a matching reconciliation token in
the same patch.

Availability is shown before confirmation; the host rechecks preconditions and
reviewed resource identity before writing. This manifest cannot execute arbitrary
code or change the host guards.

## Publisher signatures

Official releases include a detached Ed25519 signature, `manifest.json.sig`,
over the exact bytes of `manifest.json`. The public key is in
`signing-public.pem` and pinned in the srelens host. SHA256SUMS detects download
corruption; the signature authenticates the publisher. Installation still
requires explicit permission review.

The release workflow requires the repository secret `APP_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`
(PKCS#8 PEM) and fails if it is absent or does not match the published key.
Never commit the private key. Rotate by publishing a host trust-key update
before releasing manifests signed by the replacement key.
