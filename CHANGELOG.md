## 0.4.1

Signed `.srelens-extension` packages now include the official project logo,
README and license, covered by the publisher signature and package checksum.
Manifest releases remain available. Update an existing manifest installation
to this version to install the packaged logo.

# 0.4.0 — declared GitOps actions

Moves actions into the manifest with explicit primitive grants and preconditions,
using extension API `^0.3`. The host owns confirmation and stale-resource checks;
reading a resource no longer implies write access. The exact tested host revision
is pinned in `compatibility.json`. New release assets must be signed by the
existing publisher key; previously published assets are not replaced.

# 0.3.0 — detail links

Renamed the `rowActions` contribution to `detailLinks`, the read-only links in a resource's detail view
([srelens#537](https://github.com/srelens/srelens/issues/537)). Validated against srelens commit `5360059fee16560d33c05e742a95b3b64421602c`.
A host without the rename refuses this manifest, and a host with it refuses 0.2.0. There is no alias:
no extension had gone live.

# 0.2.0 — initial native preview

Extracted the existing native Flux manifest from srelens commit `29ef2ea1ce3327fd67e9d21980878653e04fe422`.
Requires the PR #508 extension-platform build; read-only and unsigned.
